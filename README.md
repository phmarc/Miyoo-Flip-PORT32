# Miyoo-Flip-PORT32 - Notes

## Emu/PORT32
Need miyoo355_rootfs_32.img and the mnt directory within the PORT32 directory for the `launch.sh` script to work with some games

## Img/PORT32
This is entirely  optional

## Roms/PORT32
The scripts in the top level directory launches the games within the directories. The game directories were either copied other locations from the stock card and/or renamed to match the script name.
